    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>LocalShare is designed to make file sharing between devices on the same network simple, fast, and secure. Unlike cloud-based services, LocalShare keeps your files local — no uploads to external servers, no delays. Using WebSocket technology, it connects your devices directly, allowing you to drag, drop, and share files instantly.</p>
    <p>Whether you're at home, in the office, or on a shared Wi-Fi, LocalShare ensures your data stays where it belongs: with you.</p>
