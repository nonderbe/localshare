    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Are my files sent over the internet?</h3>
      <p>No, your files are not sent over the internet. LocalShare operates entirely within your local network. It uses direct peer-to-peer connections via WebSocket technology, meaning your data never leaves your network or reaches external servers.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is my data safe when using this service?</h3>
      <p>Yes, your data is safe. Since LocalShare doesn’t upload your files to the cloud and only operates within your own network, your information remains private. No files are stored on our servers, and connections are secured with HTTPS. However, ensure your network itself is secure (e.g., with a strong Wi-Fi password).</p>

      <h3>What’s the fastest way to share files?</h3>
      <p>The fastest way to share files is through LocalShare’s local network connection. Unlike cloud solutions, which require uploading files to an external server and then downloading them — a process that’s significantly slower, especially for large files — LocalShare sends your data directly between devices on your network. For the best performance, particularly with large files, we recommend connecting one or more devices via an Ethernet cable instead of using Wi-Fi. This reduces latency and maximizes speed.</p>

      <h3>Does LocalShare work on iOS, Windows, macOS, or Android?</h3>
      <p>Yes, LocalShare works across all major platforms — iOS, Windows, macOS, and Android — as long as you’re using a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Since it’s a web-based application, there’s no need to install additional software. Simply access the site from your device’s browser while connected to the same local network, and you’re ready to share files.</p>
